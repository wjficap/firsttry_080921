## Wayne's abode in the Metaverse

#### i once asked a wise man:
#### How high?
#### How far?
#### How deep?
#### How pain?
#### How strong?
#### He answered: "You can be anyone you want to be in the metaverse."

### Basically a bunch of nonsensical stuff from a mix and match as a result of idle hands and in an idle workshop from an idle mind.
